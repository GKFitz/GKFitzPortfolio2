            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Gillian K Fitzgerald and I am a full-stack web developer in training. 
                I earned my bachelors degree at Columbia University in political science.
                I am an avid outdoors woman and an accomplished equestrian. While I am currently working in business development at a small family biotech investment consulting firm, I have also been involved in the comic book industry for three years, working for the legendary comic book artist, J Scott Campbell. During both of my careers it has become apparent to me that coding and web development are valuable, high demand skills that companies and small business need in order to not only be competitive in their respective markets, but to survive and effectively reach the people that need their services. I am dedicated and excited to combine the knowledge I have gained during my career with a new coding skills set in order to build things that will make businesses and individuals lives better.
